# DianaBot
Bot of ThroughTheDark's discord, built off the template made by CappeDiem

## note before usage : 
I'm dumb, so I keep pushing the token by accident, so i put the config file in .gitignore, so before usage, please create a config.json file in the same folder as app.js and put that in it : 
```json
{
    "prefix":"/",
    "token":"token_of_ur_bot"
}

```
